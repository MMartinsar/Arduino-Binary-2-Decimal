# Arduino Binary to Decimal

This project made with Arduino and coded in C++, converts a binary number from 0 to 8 to decimal, using a 7 segment visualizer to show the answer. The number must be given through a set of switches representing each power of 2 from right to left.

## Materials

- Arduino Uno R3
- Protoboard
- 7 x 220 Ω resistors
- 4 x 10 kΩ resistors
- Seven segment display (cathode)
- DIP switch interruptor x4
- Cables
