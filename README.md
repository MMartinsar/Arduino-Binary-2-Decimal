# Arduino Binary to Decimal

This project made with Arduino and coded in C++, converts a binary number from 0 to 8 to decimal, using a 7 segment visualizer to show the answer. The number must be given through a set of switches representing each power of 2 starting from the right to the left.

## Materials

- Arduino Uno R3
- 4 x LED light bulbs
- 4 x 220 Î© resistors
